# KarateFramework Learning Project

Welcome to the KarateFramework Learning Project! This project is designed to help you learn the basics of KarateFramework, a powerful tool for API testing and automation.

## Overview

KarateFramework is an open-source tool that combines API test-automation, mocks, performance testing, and even UI automation into a single, unified framework. Whether you're a seasoned QA engineer or just starting out in test automation, KarateFramework provides an easy-to-learn syntax and powerful features to make your testing experience smooth and efficient.

This project contains a set of exercises and examples to guide you through the fundamentals of KarateFramework. By following along with the exercises and running the examples, you'll gain hands-on experience with writing and executing tests, handling HTTP requests and responses, and leveraging advanced features like data-driven testing and parallel execution.
